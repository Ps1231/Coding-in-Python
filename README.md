This project helps to create bank accounts of the customers in python as per details enter by them as an input and stores the corresponding records of customers in particular table called customers created in mysql console through sql connectivity and these records can be easily accessed by the customers (only their own details) or bankers (details except security pin of customers) from the same table. Also, after performing certain tasks related to transaction i.e withdrawal and deposition of money,creating other bank accounts; corresponding changes in accounts and balances will automatically save into the same table customers i.e table will update automatically . Same records will be accessed for showing banking statistics through Matplotlib library and other details from the created table customers.
It has many advantages such as :
Records can be stored in fast manner and any record can be easily accessed.
Details can be generated as per entered PIN number and ID number which is settled as primary key in the table so that no duplicate entry can be maintained against customer ID.
“Bank Management System” has been prepared to reduce manual work and with the help of this project account details of customers can be accessed easily and total balance can be calculated automatically in fast manner.
